# Minimal Wordpress Theme With TailwindCSS
- this project uses a tailwind.css file in the /css directory
- the script does not currently bundle or minify js
- the npm script watches for changes in php files and in style.css (in the root of the theme directory) & then reloads the browser
- the css is minified and autoprefixed before it is output to style.css 
- the tailwind.config.js uses a lot of custom styles from one of my side projects as an example
- you can run the npm script by running this command:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
